# OJT Time Tracker

Hey! This is a simple tool I built for OJT or internship students to track their daily hours. It helps you stay organized without needing a complex setup. Everything is saved locally in your browser, so you don't even need an account.

### What is this for?
Basically, it's a dashboard where you can:
- Log your daily time-in and time-out.
- See how many hours you've rendered and how many you have left.
- Export all your logs to Excel (CSV) or back them up as a JSON file.

### Tech Stack
I used these tools to build it:
- **Next.js** for the framework.
- **Tailwind CSS** for the styling (sleek teal/emerald design).
- **LocalStorage** to save your data (no database needed, stays on your browser).

### How to get it running
1. Open your terminal and go to the `OJT-DTR` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to get all the necessary packages.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

That's it! Hope this helps you track your internship hours easier.
